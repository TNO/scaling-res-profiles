# Nonlinear programming (NLP) model to scale Renewable Energy Sources (RES) profiles
This repository has an NLP optimization model to scale RES profiles from historical data to future target capacity factor.

## Files description
+ **[config.toml](config.toml)**: configuration file with main parameters to run the model
+ **[constants.jl](constants.jl)**: constants values in the code
+ **[functions.jl](functions.jl)**: auxiliary file with the functions is used in the code
+ **Manifest.toml**: file with dependencies for reproducibility  
+ **Project.toml**: file with dependencies for reproducibility
+ **[RES-profile-scaling-main.jl](RES-profile-scaling-main.jl)**: main file to run the model

## Inputs
The input files were generated with the [renewables ninja](https://www.renewables.ninja/) tool. However, any hourly profile following the data format from the renewable ninja is allowed.
## Outputs
The output files include the scaled profiles, a summary file, and a summary plot.
## Optimization model

$$
\begin{align}
\displaystyle {\min_{x} {\left(\sum_{h}P_{h}^{x} - FLH\right)}^{2}}
\end{align}
$$

$s.t.$

$$
\begin{align}
x \geq 0
\end{align}
$$

Where:

$x$: decision variable to scale the hourly values of the profile

$P_{h}$: profile value at hour $h$

$FLH$: target full load hours

The objective function minimizes the squared error to the target full load hours, while constraint ensures the new coefficient is positive.
